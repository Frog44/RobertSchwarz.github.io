									<h3>Jacobs Engineering Intern / College Projects</h3>
									<p></span>Bush Intercontinental Airport Terminal – I assisted on this major airport system project in the model organization and picked up comments from professional engineers to improve MEP systems and components for the project.</p>
									<p></span>Shell Research and Development – As an intern, it was an enlightening experience to go to a major oil and gas research facility to report on the conditions of the air handling units for specific areas.</p>
									<p></span>Senior Design – My senior year in engineering required a project for a real client with a real problem. On a team of 12 students, I was able to create a massive impact in the design and development of a tool for Lockheed Martin manufacturing team that measure the grip length of holes in the airplane skin regarding the F-35 manufacturing line.</p>

									<h3>Johnston LLC</h3>
									<p></span>HC Juvenile Detention Facility – Early in my career, one of my first major projects was assisting in the mechanical design of a ground-up juvenile detention facility for Harris County. This project contained many of the common HVAC components and systems expected in most applications, but also came with many specialty related items involving security for the center, kitchen equipment calculations, and a bit of medical applications.</p>
									<p></span>HC Criminal Justice Center – A major building in downtown Houston for Harris County had major renovations, which I had a great deal in the mechanical design for. The renovations involved a complete makeover of the basement and first three floors. Additionally, this project included adding 2 elevator banks to the exterior of the building and moving the primary mechanical room to the 1st floor on platforms for flood protection. This project was a large part of my experience because it was the first time I saw my work in Revit built in the field and provided me exposure to multi-phased projects, in depth site visits, RFIs, submittals, and nearly every type of mechanical system possible in such a building.</p>
									<p></span>HC Central Plant – This was the largest project of my career. It was the renovation of one of the two central plants serving Harris County downtown. The design called for nearly double the load it currently had and required lots of collaboration across the disciplines. I had a major role in designing the layout of the new plant, phasing, and piping the mechanical lines. This project had an additional project where the objective was mapping and planning where to place temperature gauges and flow meters in nearly every primary mechanical room of the buildings connected to the Harris County downtown campus, 13 buildings, to optimize the load across the system to benefit the central plants serving the campus.</p>
									<p></span>HC Flood Project – Another one of my first projects was walking the pedestrian and utility tunnels under the Harris County downtown campus to design where to place seals for the primary water lines and flood doors for flood prevention. This project came to be due to the damage of the buildings by hurricane Harvey.</p>
									<p></span>HC Indoor Air Quality Study for Detention centers – In the summer of 2020, due to a specific global event, the county tasked us with generating solutions and report to improve the indoor air quality in their buildings, specifically their detention centers due to higher risk. I generated a report of potential solutions, with the help of an experienced PE, of possible solutions and arranged them based on effectiveness, cost, and ease of implementation. The results were that the most effective systems were UVC light and the most effective by cost and implementation were MERV-13 filters. I assisted in developing a final report and presentation to the county representatives. I learned more than most mechanical engineers about indoor air quality systems because of this project and it was a great experience.</p>
									<p></span>Ben Taub AHU – For the Ben Taub General Hospital, I assisted in the mechanical design for replacing some of the air handling units in the basement that served half the building. The challenge of this project was the existing units were built in place and could not easily be removed. Therefore, the project entailed temporary duct phasing, reusing the air handling unit housing, replacing the coils, and replacing the large constant volume fans with a fan array linked to variable speed drives. This is where I learned the massive benefits of fan arrays and VFDs. I assisted in the mechanical Revit design, site visits, and discipline collaboration.</p>
									<p></span>Ben Taub OR – In the Ben Taub General Hospital, I assisted in the mechanical design in a partial renovation in the operating rooms section of the hospital. </p>
									<p></span>BTH Garage Lobby – I provided the bulk of mechanical design to this small project that designed an enclosed lobby area around the elevator bank of a parking garage. It was in this project that I gained experience in compact mechanical systems, variable refrigerant flow, and air curtains. </p>
									<p></span>Ben Taub Campus Master Plan Revit input – As a mechanical EIT, I was tasked with fulfilling a full Revit Model of the Ben Taub campus using the most up to date information, which involved old plans that were, at best, difficult to read with other projects sets. Keeping consistency over changes and coordinating all plans proved a challenging yet rewarding endeavor.</p>
									<p></span>LBJ Emergency– I assisted in a partial renovation of LBJ hospital in Houston. </p>
									<p></span>MC Forensics Facility – I assisted in the mechanical design of a new forensic facility for Montgomery County. This was a great learning experience with new and unique systems, such as exhaust for autopsy tables, sallyport conditioning, underground ductwork, and vav boxes on the exhaust system.</p>
									<p></span>MDA EX Fans – This project involved a study of the exhaust system of 2 major buildings of MD Anderson Center in the med-center of Houston, as well as planning a like-for-like replacement of all the laboratory and medical exhaust fans on the roof. The study of the exhaust systems was to confirm the load of the fans. Also, this project involved many hours on site gathering information about the existing system and fans. Challenges in this project involved going into clean rooms of nuclear research with full medical suits and maneuvering to get on top of large exhaust fans to get pictures of equipment tags on the roof of the buildings during the summer…in Houston.</p>
									<p></span>HCC Central Plant and Small Café Study: A professional engineer and I did a campus study of Houston Community College to determine the load for a central plant across a campus and report.</p>
									<p></span>SBISD Elementary Schools – There were three elementary schools that were identical in layout and underwent major architectural renovations, that required extensive MEP design. I was able to lead the mechanical model design for these projects.</p>
									<p></span>Revit Standard Operating Procedures – During my time at this company, I contributed to the company’s development of standards and operating procedures for Revit.</p>
									<p></span>UTMB CT Scan Room Renovation – I assisted in the Revit model and load calculations for a CT scan room renovation.</p>
									<p></span>UTMB ED Renovation - I assisted in the Revit model and load calculations for a partial emergency department renovation.</p>
									<p></span>HMWB Skybridge – This project involved the design of mechanical systems across a skybridge that went through an exiting central plant. The nature of a skybridge having very little plenum space made mechanical design a challenge.</p>
									<p></span>HM CT Scan - I assisted in the Revit model and load calculations for a CT scan room renovation.</p>
									<p></span>Baytown Utility Buildings Site Report – I was part of a team for my company tasked in reporting on multiple municipal buildings in Baytown to document the conditions and propose upgrades as needed for a report. </p>
						
									<hr />

									<h3>Campos Engineering</h3>
									<p></span>UT Southwestern – I helped design the renovation of a small conference room using AutoCAD. </p>
									<p></span>FW Convention Center CP Report – A professional engineer and I walked the site and evaluated the central plant serving the Fort Worth convention center to document and report to produce a proposed solution for improvements for the facility.</p>
									<p></span>DFW Airport – This was a major project that I cannot say much about, but it involved a major renovation and more experience with airport systems.</p>
									<p></span>Texas A&M EX Fans - This project involved a study of the exhaust system of a medical laboratory study building for Texas A&M in the med-center of Houston, as well as planning a like-for-like replacement of the laboratory exhaust fans on the roof. The study of the exhaust systems was to confirm the load of the fans. Also, this project involved many hours on site gathering information about the existing system and fans.</p>
									<p></span>Bush Intercontinental Airport Terminal – I assisted on this major airport system project in the model organization and picked up comments from professional engineers to improve MEP systems and components for the project.</p>
									<p></span>TAFB Warehouse - I helped design and did calculations for the renovation of a warehouse to be repurposed using AutoCAD.</p>
									<p></span>UH AHU Replacement – I assisted in documenting and reporting the site to design a minor renovation for a space in the maintenance facility which primarily focused on replacing an air handling unit.</p>
									
									<hr />

									<h3>EXP Services</h3>
									<p></span>California Historic Hotel – I was able to assist another professional engineer in a project that involved restoring and upgrading the air handling systems in a historic hotel in California.</p>
									<p></span>Miami Aquarium Manatees – This project I made mechanical design decisions and assisted other mechanical engineers in the renovation of an aquarium building sector renovation. This gave me experience in animal-involved buildings, which is incredibly interesting.</p>
									<p></span>NCH North Naples Hospital – I assisted in the mechanical design of a new expansion to the central plant serving the campus. The coordination of this project was difficult as it required intense systems to work in conjunction with the existing plant.</p>
									<p></span>Miami Residential Tower – This was an interesting, ground-up, project for a residential complex in Miami. It involved very tight coordination to maximize space in a compact model and intense coordination with the architect. I provided major mechanical assistance with the Revit model.</p>
									<p></span>Fairmont Dallas – Performed a multiple day site visit to document position and conditions of air handling equipment serving common areas. This involved lots of documentation and managing spaces difficult to get to.</p>
									<p></span>Space Parts Manufacturing – I assisted in the design of a manufacturing space for a company specializing in thermal plate manufacturing for rockets. I collaborated with equipment manufacturers to gather sufficient information about cooling and exhaust loads for the production space.</p>
									<p></span>Fort Worth Zoo – I assisted in designing mechanical systems for animal holding and shelter for multiple species for a zoo. This project taught me about the level of detail in mechanical design that must be considered in design for the well-being of the animals.</p>
